A Hermitian space is a finite-dimensional vector space V over E together with a sesquilinear (with respect to the involution overlinephantomx) morphism Phi colon V times V to K. We will always work with an implicit canonical basis e_1dotsce_n of V. In view of this, Hermitian spaces are in bijection with Hermitian matrices over E. If V is a Hermitian space, we call the matrix G = (Phi(e_i e_j))_1 leq i j leq n in E^n times n the Gram matrix of V. We call overlinephantomx the involution of V.","category":"page"},{"location":"Hecke/quad_forms/introduction/","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"In both cases we refer to the field E as the base ring V.

These will unfortunately have to either be split between AbstractAlgebra and Nemo or a completely generic implementation for abstract types will have to be made.\nSome Hecke implementations assume sub! and friends are available in generic code.

See the specific documentation for the module of interest to see details.\nzero and one : these are implemented for parent types, which is not what Julia typically expects. Exceptions include the Flint fmpz and fmpq types, as their parents are not parameterised, which makes it possible to implement these functions for the types as well as the parents.\nrand : we have a Nemo specific rand interface, which passes the tail of a given rand invocation to the rand function for the base ring, e.g. to create random matrix elements or polynomial coefficients and so on. In addition to this custom rand interface, we also support much of the Julia rand interface, with the usual caveat that we use parent objects instead of types where necessary.\nserialisation : unfortunately this is currently NOT implemented by Nemo, but we would certainly like to see that done in the future. It's not automatic because of the C objects that underly many of our constructions.\nNumber : Nemo number types do NOT belong to Julia's Number hierarchy, as we must make all our ring element types belong to our RingElem abstract type. To make some Julia Number types cooperate with Nemo, we define the unions RingElement and FieldElement which include some Julia types, such as BigInt and Rational{BigInt}, etc. Note that fixed precision integer types cannot be expected to be well-behaved when they overflow. We recommend using Nemo integer types if one wants good performance for small machine word sized integers, but no overflow when the integer becomes large (Nemo integers are based on Flint's multiprecision fmpz type).\nhash : we implement hash functions for all major element types in Nemo.\ngetindex/setindex!/typed_hvcat : we implement these to access elements of Nemo matrices, however see the note below on row major representation. In  addition, we allow creation of matrices using the notation R[a b; c d] etc. This is done by overloading typed_hvcat for the parent object R instead of a type as Julia would normally expect.
