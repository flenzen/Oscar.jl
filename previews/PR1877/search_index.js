The remaining n_2 homogeneous coordinates are those of w and appear in the very same order as they do for w.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> P2 = projective_space(NormalToricVariety, 2)\nA normal, non-affine, smooth, projective, gorenstein, fano, 2-dimensional toric variety without torusfactor\n\njulia> v1 = P2 * P2\nA normal toric variety\n\njulia> cox_ring(v1)\nMultivariate Polynomial Ring in 6 variables xx1, xx2, xx3, yx1, ..., yx3 over Rational Field graded by\n  xx1 -> [1 0]\n  xx2 -> [1 0]\n  xx3 -> [1 0]\n  yx1 -> [0 1]\n  yx2 -> [0 1]\n  yx3 -> [0 1]\n\njulia> v2 = P2 * P2\nA normal toric variety\n\njulia> set_coordinate_names(v2, [\"x1\", \"x2\", \"x3\", \"y1\", \"y2\", \"y3\"])\n\njulia> cox_ring(v2)\nMultivariate Polynomial Ring in 6 variables x1, x2, x3, y1, ..., y3 over Rational Field graded by\n  x1 -> [1 0]\n  x2 -> [1 0]\n  x3 -> [1 0]\n  y1 -> [0 1]\n  y2 -> [0 1]\n  y3 -> [0 1]\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"ToricVarieties/NormalToricVarieties/#NormalToricVarietiesFromStarTriangulations-Tuple{Polyhedron}","page":"Normal Toric Varieties","title":"NormalToricVarietiesFromStarTriangulations","text":"NormalToricVarietiesFromStarTriangulations(P::Polyhedron)\n\nReturns the list of toric varieties obtained from fine regular star triangulations of the polyhedron P.

On a mathematical level, this establishes a construction of toric varieties for  which a Z^n grading of the Cox ring is provided. See for example Huijun Fan, Tyler Jarvis, Yongbin Ruan (2017), which describes this as GIT construction David A. Cox, John B. Little, Henry K. Schenck (2011).\n\nExplicitly, given the grading of the Cox ring, the map from the group of torus invariant Weil divisors to the class group is known. Under the assumption that the variety in question has no torus factor, we can then identify the map from the lattice to the group of torus invariant Weil divisors as the kernel of the map from the torus invariant Weil divisor to the class group. The latter is a map between free Abelian groups, i.e. is provided by an integer valued matrix. The rows of this matrix are nothing but the ray generators of the fan of the toric variety. It then remains to triangulate these rays, hence in general for a GLSM the toric variety is only unique up to fine regular star triangulations.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> charges = [[1, 1, 1]]\n1-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:\n [1, 1, 1]\n\njulia> NormalToricVarietyFromGLSM(charges)\n1-element Vector{NormalToricVariety}:\n A normal toric variety\n\nFor convenience, we also support:\n\nNormalToricVarietyFromGLSM(charges::Vector{Vector{Int}})\nNormalToricVarietyFromGLSM(charges::Vector{Vector{fmpz}})\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"ToricVarieties/NormalToricVarieties/#Properties-of-Toric-Varieties","page":"Normal Toric Varieties","title":"Properties of Toric Varieties","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"ToricVarieties/NormalToricVarieties/","page":"Normal Toric Varieties","title":"Normal Toric Varieties","text":"has_torusfactor(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\nis_affine(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\nis_complete(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\nis_fano(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\nis_gorenstein(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\nis_simplicial(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\nis_smooth(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\nis_normal(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\nis_orbifold(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\nis_projective(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\nis_projective_space(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\nis_q_gorenstein(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)","category":"page"},{"location":"ToricVarieties/NormalToricVarieties/#has_torusfactor-Tuple{Oscar.AbstractNormalToricVariety}","page":"Normal Toric Varieties","title":"has_torusfactor","text":"has_torusfactor(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\n\nChecks if the normal toric variety v has a torus factor.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> has_torusfactor(projective_space(NormalToricVariety, 2))\nfalse\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"ToricVarieties/NormalToricVarieties/#is_affine-Tuple{Oscar.AbstractNormalToricVariety}","page":"Normal Toric Varieties","title":"is_affine","text":"is_affine(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\n\nChecks if the normal toric variety v is affine.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> is_affine(projective_space(NormalToricVariety, 2))\nfalse\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"ToricVarieties/NormalToricVarieties/#is_complete-Tuple{Oscar.AbstractNormalToricVariety}","page":"Normal Toric Varieties","title":"is_complete","text":"is_complete(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\n\nChecks if the normal toric variety v is complete.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> is_complete(projective_space(NormalToricVariety, 2))\ntrue\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"ToricVarieties/NormalToricVarieties/#is_fano-Tuple{Oscar.AbstractNormalToricVariety}","page":"Normal Toric Varieties","title":"is_fano","text":"is_fano(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\n\nChecks if the normal toric variety v is fano.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> is_fano(projective_space(NormalToricVariety, 2))\ntrue\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"ToricVarieties/NormalToricVarieties/#is_gorenstein-Tuple{Oscar.AbstractNormalToricVariety}","page":"Normal Toric Varieties","title":"is_gorenstein","text":"is_gorenstein(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\n\nChecks if the normal toric variety v is Gorenstein.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> is_gorenstein(projective_space(NormalToricVariety, 2))\ntrue\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"ToricVarieties/NormalToricVarieties/#is_simplicial-Tuple{Oscar.AbstractNormalToricVariety}","page":"Normal Toric Varieties","title":"is_simplicial","text":"is_simplicial(v::AbstractNormalToricVariety)\n\nChecks if the normal toric variety v is simplicial.

Either the tests will have to be adjusted, or the Nemo exception types changed.\nRingElem is often used where RingElement is intended, etc. Also types are often unconstrained where Nemo would constrain them to RingElement.\nSome Hecke functions try to support generic types and specific concrete Nemo types in the same implementation. These will unfortunately have to either be split between AbstractAlgebra and Nemo or a completely generic implementation for abstract types will have to be made.\nSome Hecke implementations assume sub! and friends are available in generic code. These will have to be rewritten, usually by adding a single unary minus outside of a loop and switching to add! and friends inside the loops.\nTest code, docstrings and documentation will have to be added where they do not already exist.\nExports of the new functionality will have to be added.\nSome functions should be accompanied by similar functions that don't yet exist.

The argument :groebner_basis or :linear_algebra for algo_rels controls which algorithm for the computation of the relations between the fundamental invariants is used. With :groebner_basis, the relations are computed via the standard computation of a kernel of a morphism between multivariate polynomial rings.

Here is a summary of the naming convention followed in OSCAR:","category":"page"},{"location":"DeveloperDocumentation/styleguide/","page":"Developer Style Guide","title":"Developer Style Guide","text":"Use CamelCase for types and snake_case for everything else. (Internal functions do not have to follow these rules.) Types (and their constructor) tend to be in CamelCase. However, please also provide the constructor (or a constructor) in snake_case. As a user one usually does not know if something is a constructor or a function.\nNoteworthy difference to Julia base is that we do not have exceptions for is* or has* as prefix. It is is_foo instead of isfoo and has_bar instead of hasbar. The main reason is to avoid awkward constructions like isvery_ample, while also being consistent. For compatibility with standard Julia, while staying consistent internally, we also provide aliases (using AbstractAlgebra.@alias) for various standard Julia functions, e.g. is_one as alias for isone\nFor generic concepts choose generic names, based on general algebraic concepts, preferably not special names from your area of speciality.\nUse Julia conventions where applicable and when they don't contradict our own rules above.\nIn Julia we have multiple dispatch, so we do not need functions like point_from_matrix as the \"from\" part is clear by the type of the argument. It should be called points(T::Matrix) in some variation. Similarly for matrix_to_points. Of course it is fine to use them internally, where useful.\nFollow the mathematics. If your function needs a list of points, you should create a point-type (or use the one already there) and then use this. For user-facing functions, please do not use re-purposed lists, arrays, matrices...\nIf already existing types in OSCAR are almost what you need, consider improving them instead of writing your own. While it might be tempting to create a new polynomial ring type for the new application because some feature is missing, it causes a lot of work and compatibility issues: Will the new type support\nnormal functions (gcd, factor),\nquotient fields,\nmodules and residue rings,\nconversion to and from other already existing types?\nWhenever functions return the same mathematical object, but in different mathematical categories, the first argument should be the desired return type. One example is projective_space(NormalToricVariety, *) vs projective_space(ProjectiveScheme, *). However, if the return type is different, even if the result describes the same mathematical object, it should be indicated in the function name, for example automorphism_group vs automorphism_group_generators vs automorphism_list.","category":"page"},{"location":"DeveloperDocumentation/styleguide/#Code-formatting","page":"Developer Style Guide","title":"Code formatting","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"DeveloperDocumentation/styleguide/#Unicode","page":"Developer Style Guide","title":"Unicode","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"DeveloperDocumentation/styleguide/","page":"Developer Style Guide","title":"Developer Style Guide","text":"As most modern programming languages, Julia allows the use of Unicode, e.g., α, in the REPL as well as in source code.

Usually it is thus preferable to add an explicit default constructor, as in the example below.\n\nExamples\n\nApplying the macro to a struct definition results in internal storage of the attributes:\n\njulia> @attributes mutable struct MyGroup\n           order::Int\n           MyGroup(order::Int) = new(order)\n       end\n\njulia> G = MyGroup(5)\nMyGroup(5, #undef)\n\njulia> set_attribute!(G, :isfinite, :true)\n\njulia> get_attribute(G, :isfinite)\ntrue\n\nApplying the macro to a typename results in external storage of the attributes:\n\njulia> mutable struct MyOtherGroup\n           order::Int\n           MyOtherGroup(order::Int) = new(order)\n       end\n\njulia> @attributes MyOtherGroup\n\njulia> G = MyOtherGroup(5)\nMyOtherGroup(5)\n\njulia> set_attribute!(G, :isfinite, :true)\n\njulia> get_attribute(G, :isfinite)\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"macro"},{"location":"AbstractAlgebra/misc/#@attr","page":"Miscellaneous","title":"@attr","text":"@attr [RetType] funcdef\n\nThis macro is applied to the definition of a unary function, and enables caching (\"memoization\") of its return values based on the argument.

See the specific documentation for the module of interest to see details.\nzero and one : these are implemented for parent types, which is not what Julia typically expects. Exceptions include the Flint fmpz and fmpq types, as their parents are not parameterised, which makes it possible to implement these functions for the types as well as the parents.\nrand : we have a Nemo specific rand interface, which passes the tail of a given rand invocation to the rand function for the base ring, e.g. to create random matrix elements or polynomial coefficients and so on. In addition to this custom rand interface, we also support much of the Julia rand interface, with the usual caveat that we use parent objects instead of types where necessary.\nserialisation : unfortunately this is currently NOT implemented by Nemo, but we would certainly like to see that done in the future.

To make some Julia Number types cooperate with Nemo, we define the unions RingElement and FieldElement which include some Julia types, such as BigInt and Rational{BigInt}, etc. Note that fixed precision integer types cannot be expected to be well-behaved when they overflow. We recommend using Nemo integer types if one wants good performance for small machine word sized integers, but no overflow when the integer becomes large (Nemo integers are based on Flint's multiprecision fmpz type).\nhash : we implement hash functions for all major element types in Nemo.\ngetindex/setindex!/typed_hvcat : we implement these to access elements of Nemo matrices, however see the note below on row major representation. In  addition, we allow creation of matrices using the notation R[a b; c d] etc. This is done by overloading typed_hvcat for the parent object R instead of a type as Julia would normally expect.
